# slideshow-nicegui

I want to try out NiceGUI.io for something. I needed a simple slideshow this morning and thought I could code up something fast on my own, but also figured it was a good project to try NiceGUI out.

## TODOs

- Timer in slideshow. I want to change the image every X seconds but if I use my keyboard to move to the next picture I want the timer to reset.
- Multiple images on a page
